# Cloud-Based-Mobile-Internet-Protocol-Television-IPTV-Surveillance
This project is a dynamic, scalable and elastic content-based Publish/Subscribe model for IPTV surveillance system over the cloud platform. 
The proposed model allows the user to publish and view surveillance videos using a mobile application. 
(1) it represents an efficient method of pushing the messages of the Publisher/Subscriber to enable speed;
(2) it allows the content model to be used dynamically to enable efficient description of the surveillance videos;
(3) it allows a multi-domain architecture to impose parallelism; 
(4) it applies the event matching algorithm in such a way that reduces both the amount of matching inside the cloud-based IPTV surveillance system and the delay to receive subscribed content by consumers, as well as maintaining high system utilization. 
It uses the cloud as a service provider  
for IPTV encapsulated packets to enhance file transfer time. 
It is specialised in distributing video files based on the Named Data Networking(NDN) model, which is known for its speed.
